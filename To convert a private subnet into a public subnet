To convert a **private subnet into a public subnet** in AWS, you need to ensure that resources in that subnet can access the internet directly. Here's how to do it step-by-step:

---

### 🔁 **Steps to Make a Private Subnet Public**

#### 1. **Attach a Route to an Internet Gateway**
- Go to the **VPC Dashboard** in AWS Console.
- Select the **Route Table** associated with your private subnet.
- Edit the routes and **add a route**:
  - **Destination**: `0.0.0.0/0`
  - **Target**: Your **Internet Gateway (igw-xxxx)**

> If your subnet is still associated with a route table that doesn’t have this route, it remains private.

---

#### 2. **Ensure the Subnet is Associated with the Correct Route Table**
- Go to **Subnets** in the VPC Dashboard.
- Select your subnet and check the **Route Table association**.
- If needed, associate it with the route table that has the internet gateway route.

---

#### 3. **Update the Network ACLs and Security Groups**
- Ensure **Security Groups** allow inbound/outbound traffic as needed (e.g., port 80/443 for web).
- Ensure **NACLs** allow traffic to/from the internet (e.g., allow `0.0.0.0/0` for HTTP/HTTPS).

---

#### 4. **Assign Public IPs to Instances**
- Either:
  - Enable **Auto-assign Public IP** in the subnet settings.
  - Or manually assign an **Elastic IP** to your EC2 instance.
