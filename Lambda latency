**Lambda latency** refers to the time it takes for an AWS Lambda function to respond to an invocation. It can be broken down into several components:

---

### **1. Cold Start Latency**
Occurs when a new instance of the Lambda function needs to be initialized (e.g., after a period of inactivity or scaling up):

- **Initialization time**: Includes loading your code, initializing dependencies, and setting up the runtime environment.
- **Typical range**: 100ms to several seconds depending on language, package size, and VPC configuration.

---

### **2. Warm Start Latency**
Occurs when an already-initialized Lambda instance handles the request:

- **Much faster**: Usually in the range of **a few milliseconds to a few hundred milliseconds**.

---

### **3. Network Latency**
If your Lambda is triggered by or interacts with other services (e.g., API Gateway, S3, DynamoDB), network latency can add to the total response time.

---

### **4. VPC Latency**
If your Lambda function is configured to run inside a VPC, it may experience additional latency due to:

- ENI (Elastic Network Interface) setup during cold starts.
- DNS resolution and routing within the VPC.

---

### **5. Execution Duration**
This is the actual time your function takes to run your code logic. It depends on:

- Code efficiency
- External service calls
- Resource usage

---

### **Monitoring Latency**
You can monitor latency using:

- **CloudWatch Metrics**: Look for `Duration`, `InitDuration`, and `MaxDuration`.
- **X-Ray Tracing**: For detailed breakdowns of latency sources.
