The difference between **Security Groups** and **Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)** in AWS (or similar cloud environments) lies in their **scope**, **rules**, and **behavior**. Here's a clear comparison:

---

### üîê **Security Groups**
- **Level**: Instance-level (attached to EC2 instances).
- **Type**: Stateful.
- **Rules**: Only allow rules (no deny rules).
- **Traffic Flow**: Automatically allows return traffic (stateful).
- **Evaluation**: All rules are evaluated together; if one allows traffic, it's permitted.
- **Use Case**: Fine-grained control over inbound/outbound traffic to specific instances.

**Example**: If you allow inbound port 22 (SSH), the response traffic is automatically allowed outbound.

---

### üß± **Network ACLs (NACLs)**
- **Level**: Subnet-level (applied to all resources in a subnet).
- **Type**: Stateless.
- **Rules**: Allow and deny rules.
- **Traffic Flow**: Return traffic must be explicitly allowed (stateless).
- **Evaluation**: Rules are evaluated in order (numbered list).
- **Use Case**: Broad control over traffic entering and leaving a subnet.

**Example**: If you allow inbound port 80, you must also allow outbound traffic explicitly for the response.
