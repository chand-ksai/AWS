Here‚Äôs a clear comparison between **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** and **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** in AWS:

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** ‚Äì Umbrella Term
**ELB** is the general term for AWS's load balancing service. It includes three types:

1. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** ‚Äì Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)
2. **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** ‚Äì Layer 4 (TCP/UDP)
3. **Gateway Load Balancer (GLB)** ‚Äì For third-party virtual appliances

So when you say **ELB vs NLB**, you're likely comparing **ALB vs NLB**. Here's a breakdown:

---

### üåê **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
- **Layer**: 7 (Application Layer)
- **Protocol Support**: HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket
- **Routing**: Smart routing based on URL path, host headers, query strings, etc.
- **Use Case**: Web applications, microservices, container-based apps
- **Features**:
  - Content-based routing
  - SSL termination
  - WebSocket support
  - Authentication via Cognito or OIDC
  - Redirects and fixed responses

---

### üîå **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**
- **Layer**: 4 (Transport Layer)
- **Protocol Support**: TCP, UDP, TLS
- **Routing**: Based on IP protocol data
- **Use Case**: High-performance, low-latency apps (e.g., gaming, real-time systems)
- **Features**:
  - Handles millions of requests per second
  - Preserves client IP
  - Static IP support
  - TLS termination (optional)
  - Zonal failover

| Client IP Preservation   | No (unless using X-Forwarded-For) | Yes                     |
| Static IP Support        | No                           | Yes                           |
| SSL Termination          | Yes                          | Yes (optional)                |
| Health Checks            | HTTP/HTTPS                   | TCP                           |
| Use Case                 | Web apps, APIs               | Real-time apps, low latency   |
