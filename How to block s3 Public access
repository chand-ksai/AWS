Blocking public access to Amazon S3 is one of the most critical steps for securing your data—especially in enterprise environments where compliance and DLP are top priorities. Here's how to do it right:

---

### 🔐 1. **Enable Block Public Access at the Account Level**
This ensures **all current and future buckets** are protected by default.

- Go to the **S3 Console** → **Account Settings**
- Under **Block Public Access**, enable all four options:
  - Block public ACLs
  - Block public bucket policies
  - Ignore public ACLs
  - Restrict public bucket policies
- Save changes and confirm

This acts as a **global safeguard**, overriding any bucket-level misconfigurations.

---

### 📦 2. **Enable Block Public Access at the Bucket Level**
For finer control or exceptions:

- Go to the **S3 Console** → Select your bucket → **Permissions**
- Click **Edit** under “Block Public Access”
- Enable all four settings (same as above)
- Confirm and save

This ensures that even if someone tries to add a public ACL or policy, it’ll be rejected.

---

### 🧱 3. **Audit Bucket Policies and ACLs**
Even with block settings, it's good hygiene to clean up legacy permissions:

- Remove any `Principal: "*"` or `Allow` statements in bucket policies
- Delete public ACLs (e.g., `AllUsers` or `AuthenticatedUsers` grants)

Use this CLI command to check ACLs:
```bash
aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket your-bucket-name
```

---

### 🛡️ 4. **Terraform Best Practice**
If you're automating with Terraform, enforce block public access like this:

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "secure_bucket" {
  bucket                  = aws_s3_bucket.my_bucket.id
  block_public_acls       = true
  ignore_public_acls      = true
  block_public_policy     = true
  restrict_public_buckets = true
}
```

---

### ✅ Final Tip
If you're hosting a **static website** on S3, you’ll need to selectively allow public access. 
In that case, disable block settings **only for that bucket**, and use a tightly scoped bucket policy.
